    <p>As anyone in the tech space will tell you, there&rsquo;s only one consistent truth about raising money: It&rsquo;s not easy. That&rsquo;s especially the case when you&rsquo;re an up-and-comer in an industry that&rsquo;s filled with superstars and littered with sure things that have gone down in flames. A fair number of the programming on the TechCrunch+ stage will feature veteran VCs and founders as they dish out insights and tips on the financing front.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2022/?promo=post_lastdayreg_sept16#7eac49ba-745d-4b8c-a116-ac8d5ede73d9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nik MilanoviÄ‡</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2022/?promo=post_lastdayreg_sept16#7eac49ba-745d-4b8c-a116-ac8d5ede73d9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gefen Skolnick</a>, and Campfire co-founder&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2022/?promo=post_lastdayreg_sept16#7eac49ba-745d-4b8c-a116-ac8d5ede73d9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Joshua Ogundu</a>&nbsp;will hold court on growing your VC network by turning social capital into financial capital. A few hours after that, a trio of CEOs will share their best advice for finding funding when investors are keeping a tighter fist around their fund&rsquo;s capital.</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s not just about money; managers will also find a wealth of knowledge to keep them a step or three ahead of the game. Even more than funding, the success of a startup rides on the talent and intangibles of its people. Putting together a great team is imperative, which is why the TechCrunch+ stage will host conversations like &ldquo;How to Secure Those Hard to Find Hires&rdquo; with top talent executives from powerhouses like Gusto and Sequoia. The event will also feature panels on how to manage remote staff, which has become more essential than ever.</p>
    
    <p>There will be business forecasts peppered in there, too, so you&rsquo;ll have an edge on finding the next big thing in the crypto market and other burgeoning niches. And anyone in need of inspiration or wants to swap notes with other founders and startup pros will enjoy the networking lunch breaks, and will at some point probably find themselves wandering around Startup Alley, marveling at an exclusive glimpse at the future.</p>
